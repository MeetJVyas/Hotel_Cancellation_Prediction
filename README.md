# Hotel Cancellation Prediction using Random Forest Classification
Using Random Forest Calssifier to classify and predict the hotel room cancellation

Project Description:
In this particular project, I am using the Hotel Booking dataset that contains information like hotel, meal, country, meal, adult, children deposit type etc and using that to predict the chances of cancellation.
However, I am firstly pre-processing and studying the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
Data Details:
All the column names are self explanatory
